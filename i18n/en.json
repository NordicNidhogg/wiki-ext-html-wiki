Also all files will be grouped in a category by the same name.  For example, if you're importing a VIP Info Hubs collection (ie. 'docs' is the root folder), you would enter a unique Collection ID like 'VIP-1.1' so that the whole collection is imported into an article hierarchy starting with 'VIP-1.1'.  This way 10 different collections can be imported without clobbering each other.\n\nSpecifying an existing Collection name or parent path will update existing wiki content.\n\nIf you are importing a single file which should exist within an existing article hierarchy, you should specify it's 'parent' as the collection name.\n\nFor example, if importing a new 'advanced_topics07.html' that should exist at <code>'VIP-1.1/docs/htmldocs/questa_vip_user/advanced_topics07.html'</code>, the parent would be 'VIP-1.1/docs/htmldocs/questa_vip_user/'",
