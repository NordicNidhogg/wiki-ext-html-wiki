This extension to MediaWiki is used to import HTML content into the wiki.

It requires the Parsoid extension, and relies on that to transform an HTML DOM
into wikitext.

User nominates upload of file via upload form similar to upload image
User also specifies the "collection" name of where this source is coming from (e.g. The URL or website)
Later, this will need to handle zip uploads

Form file content is saved to server (tmp), and that triggers conversion attempt.
A Title is proposed from text (checked in the db), and user can override naming
HTML is converted to wiki text for the content of the article.
Image references are extracted from source, and user is allowed to nominate which images will be migrated into the wiki
For each of those images, the image asset is retrieved, uploaded with automatic file naming based on the "prefix" + src attribute.
Also, each image is tagged with the collection name for easier identification
Once all the images are contained in the wiki, the wiki markup for the article can be updated to reference those images.
(eliminate duplicate images based on checksum?)
